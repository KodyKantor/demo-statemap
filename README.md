# demo-statemap

demo-statemap is a small program that demonstrates one pattern for using the
[rust-statemap](https://github.com/kodykantor/rust-statemap) library.

The `example/` directory contains two things:
- States of the sample application serialized into the statemap format.
- A rendering of the aforementioned states in a statemap SVG (generated by
[statemap](https://github.com/joyent/statemap).
